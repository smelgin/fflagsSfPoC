# Simple Proof of Concept for Feature Flags

As we all know, Feature flags is a not-so-new concept in programming and devOps strategies. They provide many benefits as:

- Separate deployments from releases.
- Mitigate deployment risks.
- Testing in production (yes, tdddhe last and necessary round).
- Manage access to specific users on beta releases.
- Dark launches: features that wonâ€™t be used in production until they are finished and working properly.
- Canary release: release a feature for just a few users to test it in prod.

You can even sell this idea to marketing for A/B experiments on Partner Communities or Customer communities in Salesforce.

But to keep it simple and stright to the point, I made a project in a Developer org, so my use case is simple and I tried to make it financial-oriented to keep it interesting.

Let's say that there was a requirement to create a LWC to show the accounts credit scoring. The scope includes to list a few fields and show a bar chart comparing the client score and the media score for that industry. But off course, it can't be done in just one sprint (I lied, sorry), because it needs to query a webservice ... So we can approach this with a layered solution.

- First, we can deploy the MVC which includes the LWC and a few fields.
- Second, we can deploy whatever we finished on the chart part.
- And third, we can modify the chart to show the queried media score (on this topic, I created and deployed in a free host, a tiny webservice made in Rust that returns the media score per industry)

Please read the code (accountDetails LWC, scoreChart LWC, ScoreChartController and ScoreChartControllerTest apex classes) because ... *the truth is always on code*

In the second episode I'll add fflib, Nebula Logger and dependency injection to illustrate how to use them in a more complex scenario.

## Steps to install it on your own Salesforce Developer Edition Org

- Request your Salesforce Developer Org [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup)
- Install the Pablo Gonzalez Feature Flags project on it.
- Install the code on this repository.
- You must add the LWC control 'accountDetails' into the Account Record page (preferrably below the compact layout).
_(open any account record, go to the wheel, then Edit Page and drag & drop the accountDetail LWC into the layout)_

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.
